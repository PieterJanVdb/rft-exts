### Readable Fullscreen Text extension for Chrome

This project is built on a skeleton provided by the [chromex library](https://github.com/binaryage/chromex).
Its sole purpose is to set the width of the body of a page to a certain percentage and center it,
all with the idea of making pages where text spans the entire screen more readable.
