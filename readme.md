### Readable Fullscreen Text extension for Chrome

This project is built on a skeleton provided by the [chromex library](https://github.com/binaryage/chromex).
Its sole purpose is to set the width of the body of a page to a certain percentage and center it,
all with the idea of making pages where text spans the entire screen more readable. It will remember the
width for each separate website based on the hostname, with the option to clear this.
